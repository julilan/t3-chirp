# T3 Chirp

This repository follows the [T3 App tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkOSUVzOAA4) of building an Emoji Twitter clone where the user can send emoji tweets.

## Built with:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/)

## Development Status & Issues
- Planetscale DB might be sleeping (update: woken up 07-12-23)
- Logout button needed
- Connecting new auth username/uuid to db (this still needs to be manually set with Prisma, username will show as null in client until this is done)
