# Chirp

This repository follows the T3 stack [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkOSUVzOAA4) of building an Emoji Twitter Clone where the user can send emoji tweets.

## Built with:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

## Development Status 
- Database might be sleeping
- Logout button needed
- Connecting auth username/uuid to db (this still needs to be manually set with Prisma, username will be null until this is done)
